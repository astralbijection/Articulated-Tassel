# Servomechanism Congratulatory Articulation Augmentation for Tassels

The Servomechanism Congratulatory Articulation Augmentation for Tassels (SCAAT) is an innovative functional augmentation for 240mm mortarboard hats that expands the capability of said hat to allow for the automated gyration of the tassel along an an arbitrary axis, constrained to the sagittal plane of the wearer.

**In layman's terms, it turns your graduation cap into a f\*\*ing helicopter.**

Such a device does not exist within the class of modifications to mortarboards known as _decorations_. According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, a decoration is:

## decoration

**noun.** dec·​o·​ra·​tion | \\de-kə-ˈrā-shən\\

1. the act or process of decorating
2. something that adorns, enriches, or beautifies : ORNAMENT
3. a badge of honor (such as a U.S. military award)

The SCAAT does not constitute a process nor act. It was not created with the purpose of adorning, enriching, or beautifying the cap in any sense, either, nor does it have the positive externality of having aesthetic qualities. It is not a badge of honor, but a badge of disappointed acknowledgement that SCAATs are, unfortunately, devices that are not available to all graduating seniors. Therefore, it would be wrong to classify it as a decoration.

The SCAAT provides additional functionality to the existing cap, which is why it is more accurately classified as a functional augmentation. Any attempts to classify it otherwise would not be acknowledging its true nature.
